# Student-Performance-Predition
Student Performance Prediction is a project designed to predict students' exam scores based on their study habits. This project tries to understand why some studies perform better than others by analyzing their test scores and additional details using Python. 

First, we need to have a tangible dataset to use to predict students' exam scores. To have a sufficient dataset, we need to clean the data to get rid of any overlapping student data, empty data, and inaccurate data. 

Using the data given about the students, we were able to create histograms, bar graphs, dotplots to compare the correlation between two variables. Similarly, we also created specific heatmaps and color-coordinated them.

Specific models used in this project are Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier. We also created a Feature Importance Plot to get the importance score for each feature and used that information to create visual representations. 

To run the project, you have to download all of the modules listed in requirements.txt and just click the play button on the Python platform. This project is useful because it can help teachers and institutions to identify students who may need extra help at an early stage while also recognizing the factors that are impacting their performance level. It also shows how real educational data can be turned into practical insights using Python, from simple data handling with CSV files up to predictive modelling.
